# py-snap-helpers - A SNAP GPT Python wrapper

## About py_snap_helpers

SNAP is distributed together with a Python language interface called snappy, however this interface is lacking in terms of performance and ease of use (far from a python language style). 

The community has replied to this by creating numerous wrappers around the SNAP execution engine (GPT) command.  

This repository contains yet another SNAP GPT Python wrapper.

This SNAP GPT Python wrapper goal is to:

- ease the programmatic generation of SNAP GPT graphs in a Pythonic way
- provide access to all operators of all existing toolboxes
- ease the processing of these graphs with methods wrapping the system call to the SNAP GPT command
